// Vercel serverless function — reads a photo of a purchase slip/invoice and
// returns the line items, quantities, and prices as structured JSON, using
// Anthropic's Claude API (vision-capable model). This runs server-side
// specifically so the Anthropic API key never reaches the browser — unlike
// the Supabase anon key (which is designed to be public), an Anthropic API
// key is a real secret and must never be embedded in client-side code.
//
// This is Ops's own copy of the same function Food/Beverage/Maintenance
// already have (each app is a separately deployed Vercel project, so the
// code is duplicated rather than shared). Same extraction prompt as the
// others — generic to any purchase slip, so fuel receipts, workshop
// invoices, and delivery notes all fit the same shape. Ops's own callers
// mostly only use the total/supplier/date fields since fuel and repair
// slips are usually single-line, but line_items still comes through for the
// cases where a slip does list several items (e.g. a parts delivery note).
//
// Requires an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable, set in Vercel →
// Project Settings → Environment Variables (NOT in .env committed to the
// repo, and NOT in src/ anywhere).
//
// This file lives in /api, which Vercel automatically treats as a
// serverless function regardless of the frontend framework — no extra
// config needed for it to be picked up on deploy. It does NOT run under
// `npm run dev` (Vite's dev server doesn't know about /api routes); test
// after deploying, or with `vercel dev` locally.

export const config = {
  maxDuration: 30, // seconds — vision calls can take a few seconds longer than a typical API request

const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are reading a photo of a supplier purchase slip, delivery note, fuel receipt, or workshop/repair invoice for a hospitality fleet & mechanical department. Extract every line item you can read, plus the supplier/workshop/filling-station name and date if visible.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code fences, no commentary before or after), exactly matching this shape:

{
  "supplier_guess": "string or null — the supplier/vendor/workshop/filling station name printed on the slip, if visible",
  "date_guess": "YYYY-MM-DD or null — the slip's date, if visible",
  "slip_total": number or null — the grand total printed on the slip, if visible (whatever VAT treatment it's printed in — don't adjust it),
  "amounts_include_vat_guess": true, false, or null — true if the line/total amounts on the slip appear to be VAT-inclusive (e.g. a "Total incl VAT" line, a retail-style till slip with no separate ex-VAT column), false if they clearly appear to be VAT-exclusive (e.g. a tax invoice showing "Subtotal (excl VAT)" separately from a VAT line and an incl-VAT grand total), or null if you genuinely can't tell,
  "vat_rate_guess": number or null — the VAT percentage if explicitly printed on the slip (e.g. 15 for "VAT 15%"), otherwise null,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "raw_text": "string — the item/service description exactly as printed, cleaned of stray OCR noise",
      "qty": number — quantity/units, default to 1 if not shown separately (e.g. litres for fuel, or 1 for a single repair job),
      "unit_price": number or null — price per unit if shown, in whatever VAT treatment is printed,
      "total_price": number — the line total, in whatever VAT treatment is printed (don't convert it — that's handled separately). If only unit_price is shown, compute qty * unit_price. If only total_price is shown, leave unit_price null.
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Only include real purchasable/billable line items — skip subtotals, tax lines, discounts, and the grand total line itself (that goes in slip_total instead).
- A fuel receipt usually has exactly one line item (the litres and price); a workshop invoice may list labour and parts as separate lines, or just one lump sum — extract however it's actually printed rather than forcing a split that isn't there.
- If a quantity or price is genuinely illegible, make your best reasonable estimate rather than omitting the line, but keep raw_text faithful to what's printed.
- Numbers must be plain JSON numbers, not strings, and not include currency symbols.
- Report prices exactly as printed on the slip — do not attempt to add or remove VAT yourself, that's handled by the app afterward based on amounts_include_vat_guess and vat_rate_guess.
- If the image isn't a purchase slip/invoice/receipt at all, or nothing is legible, return an empty line_items array.`
