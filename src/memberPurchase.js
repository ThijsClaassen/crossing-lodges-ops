// Member Purchase quick-log — lets a purchase made on a member's behalf
// get logged straight to their account in the Finance Dashboard, without
// it also becoming part of this app's own stock/fleet records. Pure
// pass-through spend: deliberately does NOT touch parts_purchases,
// diesel_deliveries, petrol_purchases, or repairs — it only ever writes to
// member_charges, the same shared table the Finance Dashboard's Member
// Accounts tab reads from (same Supabase project — see that app's
// memberBilling.js for the full feature).
//
// Only relevant when companies.member_billing_enabled is true for the
// current company (see CompanyContext.jsx's memberBillingEnabled) — off
// for every real lodge today, on for the Demo company only.
